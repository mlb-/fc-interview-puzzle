Funding Circle coding challenge

## Usage

To run:

    $ lein run

## Options

No options are accepted.

### Notes

- Consider complexity.
- How fast does your code run?

  This code takes about 20 seconds to run on my laptop, but the
  majority of the time spent is due to JVM/Clojure startup.

- How does it scale?
- Consider cases where we want N primes.
